		<p id="intro">American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of association
			football and rugby football. The first game of American football was played on November 6, 1869, between two
			college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, under rules based on the association football rules of the time.[2]
			During the latter half of the 1870s, colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby Union code,
			which allowed carrying the ball. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the
			&quot;Father of American Football,&quot; established the snap, eleven-player teams, and the concept of
			downs; later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size and
			shape of the football.</p>
		<p>American football as a whole is the most popular sport in the United States; professional football and
			college football are the most popular forms of the game, with the other major levels being high school and
			youth football. As of 2012, nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the
			sport in the United States annually. The National Football League, the most popular American football
			league, has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world; its championship game, the
			Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world, and the league has an annual
			revenue of around US$10 billion.</p>

		<p>Early history</p>
		<p> American football evolved from the sports of association football and rugby football. Rugby football and
			association football, like American football, are sports where two competing teams vie for control of a
			ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.
		</p>
		<p>The first American football game was played on November 6, 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton. The game was
			played between two teams of 25 players each, used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried, but
			it could be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the ultimate goal of advancing it
			into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6-4. Collegiate play continued for several years in which
			matches were played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and
			Rutgers met on October 19, 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to. Teams were
			set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122 m Ã— 76 m) were specified. Harvard abstained from
			the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.</p>
		<p>An 1875 Harvard-Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two impressed Princeton athletes.
			These players introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the Professional Football Researchers Association
			compared to &quot;selling refrigerators to Eskimos.&quot; Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Columbia then agreed
			to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system. These schools
			formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player Walter
			Camp, now regarded as the &quot;Father of American Football,&quot; secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced
			the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap to replace the chaotic and inconsistent
			scrum.</p>
